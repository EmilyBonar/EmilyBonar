### Hi there, I'm Emily ðŸ‘‹

I graduated as a Materials Engineer from Rice University in 2018. I have a strong background in 3D printing, especially when it comes to materials other than plastic filament. I've been coding for a long time, but now I'm building out my foundations and getting experience with all kinds of projects.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on developing my skills and professional brand
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects that help people live better lives
- ðŸŒ± Currently learning: JavaScript
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about 3D printing!
- âš¡ Fun fact: Currently the longest carbon nanotube ever produced was 550mm long, in 2013. CNTs are one of the top candidates for constructing a space elevator, but for that we need one about 9 million times longer!
