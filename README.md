## Hi there, I'm Emily 👋

I graduated as a Materials Engineer from Rice University in 2018. I've been working as a Software Developer since then, first using LabVIEW and Python and currently with React and TypeScript. A while ago I was in a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) and making lots of web projects, usually with a mix of TypeScript, React, and TailwindCSS. I'm currently a Frontend Developer working on [Determined AI](https://github.com/determined-ai/determined) at HPE!

- ⚡ Fun fact: Currently the longest carbon nanotube ever produced was 550mm long, in 2013. CNTs are one of the top candidates for constructing a space elevator, but for that we need one about 9 million times longer!
