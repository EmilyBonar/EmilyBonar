### Hi there, I'm Emily ðŸ‘‹

I graduated as a Materials Engineer from Rice University in 2018. I've been working as a Software Developer since then, using LabVIEW and Python. I'm currently in a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) and making lots of web projects, usually with a mix of TypeScript, React, and TailwindCSS

- ðŸŒ± Currently learning: TypeScript
- ðŸŽ¨ [Check out the projects I've made!](https://www.emilybonar.com/projects)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to work as a **Frontend Developer** in **React**
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: she/her
- âš¡ Fun fact: Currently the longest carbon nanotube ever produced was 550mm long, in 2013. CNTs are one of the top candidates for constructing a space elevator, but for that we need one about 9 million times longer!
